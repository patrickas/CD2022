Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book “The Selfish Gene”, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term “meme”. With his book “The Extended Phenotype”, published in 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism’s body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well-known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his most popular book, “The God Delusion”, published in 2006, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual."

Victoria’s art has been a lifelong quest of “de-othering” people through art, public speaking and personal aesthetic choice. Her art ranges from bodypainting, makeup, photography, sculpture, performances, installations, digital art, clothing design, drawing and painting with science and technology. She uses bodypainting as a way of empowering the human spirit, giving the person painted a new found confidence that can be life changing."

		{{ partial "media_photo" (dict "outer" . "name" "Sara Nabil" "image" "NABIL SARA" "title" "PHOTOGRAPHER, ARTIST, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST" "bio" "Sara Nabil is an Afghan photographer, artist, political scientist, and human rights activist. Nabil employs her photography and performances to  protest and a critique of patriarchal structures – an essential means of shaping social change. In her spatial installations and photography, she combines themes of flight, dream and identity and campaigns for the equality of women and girls. The artistic work gives her back the voice that was taken from her in her home country. Sara Nabil was born in 1994 in the Afghan capital Kabul and went to school after the Taliban regime was overthrown in 2001. As a teenager, she began to study modern art at the Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA). In 2008, she participated in an exhibition that was also shown in Germany. She then studied political science at Karwan University in Kabul beginning in 2013. Even then, as a women's rights activist and artist, she was threatened by the Taliban. In December 2014, she witnessed a suicide bombing at the university. A man blew himself up in front of her. For Nabil, it was a decisive turning point: “This time I survived, but next time I will die,” she recalls thinking. Shortly after, in February 2015, she took advantage of an invitation to a student conference in the Netherlands to ask for political asylum in Germany."

Her first record, “An Atheist Album” is a passionate response to dogmatic belief, inequality, religious oppression and the idea that only the devout can be grateful and good. The record gives a voice to the often-underrepresented views of non-religious people, the fastest growing minority in many countries. It also creates opportunities to discuss issues of secularism with the mainstream media. Her voice has taken her around the world including England, Australia and ten tours of the United States. She has released seven recording projects of her own and runs independent record label True Music where she works with other artists.

She was an art teacher at a Montessori school from 2006-2007. After a year of sailing 2007-2008, she studied at the School of Architecture LTH and 2009-2016 psychology at Lund University with a specialization in environmental psychology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. In 2006, the Green Party recruited her to municipal politics in Svalöv. In the autumn, she joined the municipal board. In 2012, she opposed a demolition that the municipality decided. She became an activist to stop the demolition, but the property was still leveled. In 2013, she left politics in protest. But in 2014 he was convinced to come back and in February was put up for election to the Riksdag list in western Skåne. In the spring of 2012, she had become an activist in Femen and founded Femen Sweden. She has since participated in several actions in Sweden. An action in Almedalen in 2014 received a great deal of attention and tangible consequences. It led to her receiving an ultimatum from the Green Party: either continued parliamentary candidacy or continued Femen activism. Her art and activism are clearly united. It’s performance, body art, and image. Recurring themes are the right of women and the de-sexualization and liberation of the naked female body. She has devoted a large part of her art to painting vulvae, like Carolina Falkholt, among others."
