{{ partial "speaker" (dict "outer" .

Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book “The Selfish Gene”, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term “meme”. With his book “The Extended Phenotype”, published in 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism’s body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well-known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his most popular book, “The God Delusion”, published in 2006, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual."

This book was a warning to the West about the dangers of political Islam and multiculturalism. Since 1998, Ibn Warraq has edited several books of Koranic criticism and on the origins of Islam: “The Origins of the Koran” (1998), “The Quest for the Historical Muhammad” (2000), “What the Koran Really Says” (2002), “Which Koran?” (2011), and “Christmas in the Koran” (2014). Ibn Warraq’s “Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said’s Orientalism” (2007) was described by Paul Berman as “a glorious work of scholarship and it is going to contribute mightily to modernizing the way we think about Western civilization and the rest of the world.” In “Why the West is Best” (2011), Ibn Warraq again defends Western civilization and seeks to regain Western civilizational self-confidence and to alleviate the Western burden of guilt about slavery and colonialism pointing out that Islamic civilization was a greater slaver, greater colonialist, and destroyed many cultures when it imposed Islam. The West, on the other hand, was the first to abolish slavery, and preserved, and encouraged the study of, non-Western cultures." "website" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Warraq" ) }}
