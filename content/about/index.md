                    Organized by the “Freethought Lebanon” and 
                    “Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain”, with the support of 
                    “VHS Cologne”, this conference will gather nearly 50
                    speakers from 30 countries worldwide, to celebrate
                    freethought and dissent through talks, poetry, film,
                    music, and comedy.

                    Countless atheists, non-believers and ex-Muslims
                    continue to face persecution around the world. These
                    include threats of social exclusion, economic
                    discrimination, physical and emotional abuse, legal
                    oppression, gender-based violence, and even death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite this, every criticism of Islam is considered
                    ‘Islamophobia’ by some on the regressive Left, whilst
                    every refugee or Muslim is portrayed as a threat by the
                    far-Right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supporting ex-Muslims, however, is a human rights issue. A
                    defense of freedom of conscience and expression, includes the
                    right to be free from and criticize Islam and the religious-Right.
                    Also, xenophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry dehumanizes and
                    endangers all those deemed ‘other,’ including ex-Muslims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than ever, it is paramount to highlight and
                    strengthen individuals and organizations that protect
                    the rights of Islam’s non-believers, challenge apostasy
                    and blasphemy laws and confront xenophobia. Like the
                    religious-Right, secularists must network and
                    coordinate efforts globally to bring about change.

        <p>
            Celebrating Dissent 2022 aims to bring ex-Muslim activists together
            to strategize, gain strength, and increase visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the core of the conference lies the right of Islam’s non-believers to question,
            doubt, challenge and celebrate the rights to apostasy and blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conference aims to achieve two goals:

                Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain
                was established in June 2007 to
                break the taboo that comes with
                leaving Islam, highlight the plight of
                ex-Muslims, and challenge apostasy
                and blasphemy laws. CEMB stands
                against all forms of bigotry and
                unequivocally defends reason,
                freedom of conscience and
                expression, rights and secularism.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the last 15 years, CEMB has
                provided assistance to thousands of
                ex-Muslims worldwide, created
                support groups, solidarity actions
                and educational materials, including
                the film Women Leaving Islam and
                the Woman’s Quran and helped

                    People from various countries and backgrounds came
                    together to celebrate freedom through theatre, talks,
